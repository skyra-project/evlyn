# Story

In Skyra's lore, Evlyn is one of the most known healers, recognized for surviving extreme conditions and healed
thousands of injuried soldiers. As a bot, her work reflects her work in the lore: monitor and reviving her teammates.

For the same reason, when Aelia, Alestra, or Skyra, go down, Evlyn is capable of "reviving" them by detecting when they
go down or something goes wrong. Additionally, Evlyn is connected with both units and can offer help with heavy tasks.
